# hello-world
Just a test repository

I like writing in Python 3.x and Java mostly, but I also write C++ and
Javascript. My favorite way to make websites is with Python + CGI -
why write HTML when you can write HTML with Python (Also the server side
coding means you can share only what you mean to with the user)?

I also write Hardware in VHDL (a language for describing hardware in
FPGAs) and Python (high level languages writing low level architecture?
What has this world come to?!). Thanks Xilinx for the PYNK, very cool.
Besides that I also know how to write assembly, especially for AVR chips.
Thanks Atmel, also very cool.

Anyway, I like esoteric languages too, like brainf\*ck or unLambda. Sometimes
the only way to write code is in such a way that no one including the author
can read it. But really its about the challenge, I enjoy thinking out
of the box with hard rules and abstract concepts.

Alright, that's probably enough. Look forward to some intersting stuff on here.

Thanks.
